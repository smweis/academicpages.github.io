Steven Weisberg graduated from the College of William and Mary in 2008 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology. Working in a sensation and perception lab with [Jeanine Stefanucci](https://psych.utah.edu/people/faculty/stefanucci-jeanine.php) encouraged him to pursue a PhD in cognitive psychology. In graduate school at Temple University’s Brain and Cognitive Science (BCS) program, Steven has worked with [Nora Newcombe](https://sites.temple.edu/newcombe/) on a range of projects investigating human spatial navigation. His research in graduate school used behavioral techniques in virtual environments and the real world to explore individual differences in spatial navigation, and discover how those differences come about, particularly in the 3-dimensional world. Read about some of his research here, or see a list of publications here.

Starting in January 2015, Steven has worked as a postdoc with [Anjan Chatterjee](http://ccn.upenn.edu/chatterjee/) and [Russell Epstein](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/psych/epsteinlab/) at the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Cognitive Neuroscience. His research at Penn explores how navigation related information is communicated through various formats: arrows, words, visual scenes, and compasses.

Outside of research life, Steven can be found playing or watching one of any number of sports (depending on the season, but mostly ultimate frisbee), playing the guitar, cooking, solving puzzles, playing word games, or reading. Growing up in the Philadelphia area, Steven has a love of all things Philly, but a healthy appetite for travel and new adventures, always looking for the next exciting challenge.
